# DMS 2022-2023 Frontend service

This frontend serves as the human interface for the other services of the appliance.

## Installation

Run `./install.sh` for an automated installation.

To manually install the service:

```bash
# Install the service itself.
pip3 install .
#   (run this instead to install locally in "editable mode"):
# pip3 install --user -e .
```

## Configuration

Configuration will be loaded from the default user configuration directory, subpath `dms2223frontend/config.yml`. This path is thus usually `${HOME}/.config/dms2223frontend/config.yml` in most Linux distros.

The configuration file is a YAML dictionary with the following configurable parameters:

- `service_host` (mandatory): The service host.
- `service_port` (mandatory): The service port.
- `debug`: If set to true, the service will run in debug mode.
- `app_secret_key`: A secret used to sign the session cookies.
- `auth_service`: A dictionary with the configuration needed to connect to the authentication service.
  - `host` and `port`: Host and port used to connect to the service.
- `backend_service`: A dictionary with the configuration needed to connect to the backend service.
  - `host` and `port`: Host and port used to connect to the service.

## Running the service

Just run `dms2223frontend` as any other program.

## Services integration

The frontend service is integrated with both the backend and the authentication services. To do so it uses two different API keys (each must be whitelisted in its corresponding service); it is a bad practice to use the same key for different services, as those with access to the whitelist in one can create impostor clients to operate on the other.

## Authentication workflow

Most, if not all operations, require a user session as an authorization mechanism.

Users through this frontend must first log in with their credentials. If they are accepted by the authorization service, a user session token will be generated and returned to the frontend. The frontend will then store the token, encrypted and signed, as a session cookie.

Most of the interactions with the frontend check and refresh this token, so as long as the service is used, the session will be kept open.

If the frontend is kept idle for a long period of time, the session is closed (via a logout), or the token is lost with the cookie (e.g., closing the web browser) the session will be lost and the cycle must start again with a login.

## UI pages and components
